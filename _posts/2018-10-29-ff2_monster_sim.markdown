    The Final Fantasy 2 Monster Sim recreates the original game's battle system
    then pits two teams of monsters against each other to see which would win. <br/>
    It was developed in <strong>C#</strong> using the <strong>MonoGame</strong> engine
    and it is planned to be extended into a fully functioning site like <a href="http://saltybet.com/">SaltyBet</a> 
    by using a <strong>MEAN Stack</strong>.
