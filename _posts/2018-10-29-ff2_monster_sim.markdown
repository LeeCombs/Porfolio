  The Final Fantasy 2 Monster Sim recreates the original game's battle system
  then pits two teams of monsters against each other to see which would win. <br/>
  It was developed in <strong>C#</strong> using the <strong>MonoGame</strong> engine
  and it is planned to be extended into a fully functioning site like <a href="http://saltybet.com/">SaltyBet</a> 
  by using a <strong>MEAN Stack</strong>.

- 128 Monsters

- Writing Tests, validating data
