short_description: Idle/incremental Space Invaders Style Game
description: |
    Idle Space Invaders is an idle/incremental Space Invaders style game that I'm developing to both teach myself how to use Unity, as well as practice game development. Hopefully this will be one of the few projects that are seen through to completion and release, and that will hopefully get a handful of players! Once completed, it will be released on Kongregate, and I will create tutorials for Unity based on my experiences.

# Overview
I'm working on this game so that I can finally produce a small game and release it to the masses. Up until now, all games have been small side projects that have both too broad and too large for a starter project.

Inspiration came from an idle Breakout style game, where I figured that extending the style onto other arcade classics would be a good way to keep the scope limited and the project small.

I also wanted an opportunity to learn **Unity**, which also allows me to work on my **C#** skills.

# Challenges
Making a game, even a small one, can prove to be surprisingly difficult. The amount of systems necessary for a robust, easy-to-manage codebase doesn't make itself apparent initially. Many of the smaller features have led to the implementation and integration of new systems, as well as the necessity of stepping back and ensuring that everything is as decoupled as they should be.

The system design was something that I didn't give enough planning to from the start. This is mainly to do inexperience as I'm learning how to use Unity, and how to design a game's system. As new things pop up and become apparent, it quickly becomes necessary to step back and refactor the codebase.

At times, this has led to premature optimization, something I used to struggle with. Thankfully, however, I have been able to stop myself from optimizing systems as they're created, and instead wait until it has reached completion, or a particular goal. I am then better able to observe the interactions between systems and the framework, and make better optimization decisions.

# Future Plans
Actually complete the project and release it on sites like Kongregate. Kongregate seems to favor idle and incremental games, and if I can produce a game that's among the top three most popular released for the month, I could actually make my first development dollar!

Games like this aren't completed upon release. To ensure that players keep coming back to the game, bug fixes and additional content will need to be developed for a time after release, based on feedback provided by the community.

I will also write various how-to guides for my Fractal Pixels site based on what I've learned through Unity. I've already written guides for creating Progress Bars, and will do ones for a basic Space Invaders style game, object recycling, and anything else that comes up during development.

Once the game approaches the end of its lifecycle, I plan on continuing this style of game development as I learn Unity.
