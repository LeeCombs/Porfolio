  Here is a handful of the more interesting projects I worked on while earning my diploma is Computer Systems Technology at Camosun College. Most of them are pretty surface level, and the more interesting ones were the group projects.

# Stackbutton
Stackbutton was a Camosun College Capstone project created over three months for Cloud Compass Computing.  The project was created to gain insight into creating a tool for DevOps to evaulate cloud resources. It was made by a team of three: Myself as the Lead Developer, Curtis as the Team Lead, and Sheryll as the Project Manager. It was developed using **Angular 2+**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Sails.js**, used **PatternFly** as the UI framework, and **Docker** to containerize it.

You can see more about this project on its [project page](http://leecombs.me/projects/stackbutton.html).

# Chance-It!
Chance-It! was a game where the object of the game was to roll dice and gain an ever-increasing score, with the chance of losing ebverything. You could play against a local player, a local computer opponent, or with someone on a local network. The team completed the project ahead of schedule, and then won 'Best "AI" (Best If Statement Block)' among our peers when battling other team's computer opponents.

It was a command line program developed in **C** by a team of four, with me as the Lead Developer. At the time I was the most comfortable with programming, so I initially wrote the main loop of the game, then moved onto working with each team member plan out and discuss their contributions to the project. Easily the best part of the project were the heated discussions about the architecture of the program, as well as getting each member of the team to create their own "AI" and pitting them against eachother to see how they held up.

# Comp 132 - Java
This course included creating basic **Java** applications mainly involving drawing things to the screen, or loading and editing pictures to create generated collages, and creating a virtual shopping cart and cash register, calculating the totals, determining change, and figuring out which denominations to pay out. The final project was to create a Hangman game that picked a random word from a supplied dictionary, or use a user-generated string as the input. It could be played with a single player, or with two players. Nothing fancy, but it got the basics of the java language explained.

# Comp 157 - Windows applications
This course included creating Windows Applications using the **.NET** framework, and they were written in **C#**. Most of the labs involved creating Windows Forms to create the UI, while the rest relied simply on the console. Some labs involved using **SQL** and **LINQ** to query **SQL** databases, massaging the data as required, and displaying the information to the user as needed.

### Final Lab
A program was created that connected to and queried a Microsoft SQL Server database using Microsoft ADO.NET. We defined entity classes that held data retrieved from the databaes. We used **LINQ** to perform **SQL** queries against the database to populate these classes. 

### Memory Game
Simple game of memory written in **C#**. The player selects one of several grid size presets then, when the player starts the game, 6 blue squares will populate the grid, show for a second, then disappear. The player must memorize and find the blue squares amongst the grid. Two difficulty options are present to allow the player more time to memorize the positions.

### Rich-Text and Web Browser
Windows form GUI application that contains a simlpe rich-text editor and a web browser made using Visual Studio and **VB.NET**. The object of the lab is to practice VB.NET programming and UI developement.
