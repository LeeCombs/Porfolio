short_description: Various Layouts Recreated for Practice
description: |
    I'm recreating various front end layouts in an attempt to de-rust and practice my HTML, CSS, JS, etc. Nothing really goes beyond the first page, unless otherwise stated. I'm keeping it simple with just basic HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Overview
I'm working through recreating some simple and interesting site layouts to practice my **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS** skills. I'm keeping it basic so that I can keep the front end rust off.

Currently I have three simple projects up, and will add to this as they are completed.

You can see everything I've completed so far on [My CodePen Profile Here](https://codepen.io/LeeCombs/#).

# Challenges
Not being a dedicated front end developer means that the rust builds up quickly. Most initial steps have to be googled, forgetting the neat little CSS tricks, and getting into the rectangles everywhere design head space takes a moment, but thankfully doesn't last very long.

Keeping this surface level means that I don't get to really practice stuff like Angular, TypeScript, SASS, CoffeeScript, really any of the new and improved languages; those are saved for other, more substantial, projects.
