    Fractal Pixels aims to be an independent game developer’s site that will hopefully host my game(s) and development blog! While it’s a little barren now, expect content ranging from tutorials to my experiences of learning how to develop games.

# Overview
I made this site to serve as a base for my game development as well as various tutorials I've written while learning different things, from installing frameworks to creating Unity UI elements. It, like this site, is hosted on Github and is powered by **Jekyll**, which uses **Liquid**, **Markdown**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

Recently the site has "boomed" to double-digit dailt viewers, up from single-digit viewership! 

# Challenges

Not many so far, mainly just getting the page setup on Github, and learning how Jekyll works. The biggest issue so far with setup was getting https to work nicely.

Apart from that, determining content for the site has proved a challenge. Trying to figure out what I think might be useful to the public is difficult, so I've moved onto more simply writing guides for myself instead, and then hope that other people find value in it.

# The Take Away
I'd say the take away so far is that it's fun and interesting to try to write guides that someone else, and also myself, may find useful. What I've really earned from it is a better understanding of how to effectively communicate programming ideas and designs to others, instead of keeping that information to myself.
