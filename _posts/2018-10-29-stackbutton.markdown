# Overview
Stackbutton was a Camosun College Capstone project created over three months for Cloud Compass Computing. 
It was developed using **Angular 2+**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Sails.js**, used **PatternFly** as the UI framework, and **Docker** to containerize it.

# Challenges

### PatternFly
PatternyFly was chosen by the sponsors to be the UI framework as it is used within many Red Head-endorsed enterprise tools. However, at the time of the project PatternFly was designed to integrate with AngularJS, instead of the Angular 2 we were using. While reuse of the styles were of the biggest benefit for the project, interactive elements such as data visualization required porting the existing code, which was out of the scope of the project. PatternFly documentation was also lacking and was built using an examples-only model.

The benefit of this, however, was that the team was able to do source code analysis of both the existing framework, and of the community-driven project aimed at porting some PatternFly tools to Angular 2. As we did some of the porting of the code, we were able to gain experience in both AngularJs and Angular 2.

### Time Constraint
The project had a 3 month time frame. Initially, the sponsors were unable to decide on whether we were going to continue working on the previous team's code base, written in AngularJS, or scrap it and move onto newer technology. It took roughly a month for a decision to be made.

During this time we were able to read through the existing code base, get a feel for AngularJS, and finish up a couple of TODOs left by the previous team. Our team was then able to quickly switch gears and move onto Angular 2 when the project's needs were changed. Having to learn two web front-ends within a short time frame was rough, but the team was able to pull it off successfully, while learning how to effectively communicate in a fast-paced environment.
