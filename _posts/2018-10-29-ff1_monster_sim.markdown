  The Final Fantasy 1 Monster Sim recreates the original game's battle system
  then pits two teams of monsters against each other to see which would win. <br/>
  It was developed using the 2D game engine <strong>HaxeFlixel</strong>, and is currently hosted on 
  Heroku <a href="https://floating-bayou-94012.herokuapp.com/">here</a> (give it a minute to spin up).
