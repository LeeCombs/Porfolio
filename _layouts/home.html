              <p>I’m Lee Combs and I recently moved to London, Ontario and I’m looking to start my career as a software developer. I’m into gaming, reading, traveling, board games, and I recently got a golden retriever, Zelda, and an orange tabby, Cinder!</p>
              <p>I am a self-taught developer who got my start by pursuing an interest in game development, my first language being <strong>Actionscript 3</strong>. Since then I have received a Computer Systems Technology diploma from Camosun College, and have started a handful of projects in an attempt to learn new languages.</p>

                <p>Here are some things that I have been working on. Most recently my biggest project is Fractal Pixels, which is my site for game development tutorials that I write up while learning <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>. It currently gets double digit views every day! I'm also working on recreating site layouts to brush up on <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JS</strong>, which is currently hosted on CodePen.</p>

              <p>I graduated from Camosun College, obtaining a diploma in Computer Systems Technology. I was lucky enough to work with a wide variety of fellow students and, most proudly, worked for Cloud Compass Computing with an incredible team to develop and deliver their product "StackButton".</p>
              <p>I've worked in retail since, I believe, 2009. During that time I've worked in a handful of different departments, from the high energy Deli with a wide variety of interesting customers, to the methodical File Maintenance where accuracy and teamwork are king.</p>
